			<para>
			    Util System Plugin provides utility type system convenience functions that can be utilized in common.
			    This plugin supports execution in the utility type within the application by wrapping open source functions 
			    to easily get information on System, Network, FileSystem using open source Sigar that provides information such as each OS system, file system, process as standardized API,   
			    and provides a structure to gather and access various system resource information through a single route of SigarAccessor.
			</para>
			<para>
			    Util System Plugin also provides the java compression/decompression function that uses the functions of open source Commons Compress and JDK through ZipUtil.
			</para>
			<para>
			 	System function processing through execution of Shell Script is also possible. When Sigar is not used, the procedures are usually required that extract wanted information by executing Shell Script (or simple system commands) for each OS through the exec method of Rutime and parsing the result 
			 	to process the system in the java environment. The ScriptExecutor function is included that turns those series of procedures into modules for reuse, 
			 	but the currently provided execution functions are limited to directory size check, memory usage check, and mac address and port scan information check.
